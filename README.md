## Hi, I'm Golam Choudhury
### Welcome To My Profile! ðŸ˜„

### About me
I graduated from City, University of London in 2020 with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering and I have recently completed Java SDET Consultant training at Sparta Global. Currently, I am now working with my second client as a Junior Java SDET consultant. 

I started self-teaching programming in the summer of 2020 soon after my graduation and have developed a whole host of skills since. Please see my "Skills" section below to know more about some of the things I've learnt during this time!
